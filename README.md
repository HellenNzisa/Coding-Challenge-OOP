## 📚 About This Repository

This repository contains all my Object-Oriented Programming assignments for the ICS 2101 course.  
All code is written in Java and demonstrates various OOP concepts taught throughout the semester.

The files are organized into folders based on topics or principles applied for clarity and easier navigation.

## 🗂️ Folder & File Structure

- `ArrayChallengeOOP/` – Java challenges focused on arrays and sorting
- `inheritance/` – A console-based application demonstrating inheritance, encapsulation, and object manipulation
- `SOLID-Principles/` – Demonstration of SOLID principles using a LawLink client system
- Standalone `.java` files – Simple exercises and class-based challenges (e.g., `Account.java`, `createaccount.java`, etc.)

---

## 💡 Notes

- All `.class` files are compiled versions of their corresponding `.java` files.
- To test any program, compile the `.java` file using a Java compiler (`javac`) and run it with `java`.
